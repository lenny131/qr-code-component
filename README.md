## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS

### Implementation

This project uses plain HTML and CSS without any additional libraries or frameworks.
I used semantic tags when possible, including the article element for the QR code component.
All styling is in main.css; index.html contains only the page content with no inline styles.

<!-- ### What I learned -->

### Continued development

My goal is to continue practicing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Afterwards, I plan on learning React.
